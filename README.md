## Troubleshooting

### I do not have the openweathermap api key

Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and generate a key, then run

    export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

### I have installed the package but cannot run the command

Check if your path is correctly set


    > npm get prefix

    > export PATH="[prefix]/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
    
    > source ~/.bash_profile
